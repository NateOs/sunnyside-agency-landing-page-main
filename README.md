## Overview
The main idea is to cater for two viewports whilst sticking to as much styling as possible @mobile 375px and devices above 1440px, not enough time for me to add between, will figure that out later.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

I gotta say my googling skills on the frontend has improved greatly whilst implementing this design.
I have had more practice with flex and grid as well.
